set up fun


Hello Peeps, 
I figured I get the GitHup up and running. Just finished Programming Logic and will have 3 programming classes in Spring This old dog learning new tricks. Programming logic was all therory and persoudo code untill the last three weeks. Then it was download Eclips and teach yourself Java. It might not of been so grueling but I couldnt get eclips to configure right it's tools where not and still not right.... No help from instructor on Eclips is supose to function... I degrease, I entered the last three weeks with a 98%. I let you know how it turned out after Instructor(more like an online monitor) returnes grades. The final progest was The leap Year guessing game, which was to be written in Java.  At 54 collage again is a trip.
